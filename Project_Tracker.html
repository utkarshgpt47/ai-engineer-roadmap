    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony (Tailwind Slate/Zinc with Sky accent) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as an interactive dashboard centered around a 24-month timeline. This structure was chosen over a linear document to make the extensive information manageable and actionable. The user can get a high-level overview from the timeline and dive into specific details on demand. A persistent sidebar navigation allows for non-linear, thematic exploration of key content pillars (Projects, Resources, Tools), which is more user-friendly for quickly referencing specific information. This interactive, component-based structure aims to reduce cognitive load and turn the roadmap from a static document into a dynamic personal guide. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Roadmap Timeline (HTML/CSS/JS): Report Info -> 24-month plan. Goal -> Organize/Change. Viz -> Interactive timeline. Interaction -> Click to display monthly details. Justification -> Visualizes the entire journey and provides a clear "you are here" map.
        - Skill Transformation Radar Chart (Chart.js): Report Info -> User's starting vs. target skills. Goal -> Inform. Viz -> Radar Chart. Interaction -> Static. Justification -> Powerfully visualizes the "why" of the journey in a single graphic.
        - Project Portfolio (HTML/CSS/JS): Report Info -> All suggested projects. Goal -> Organize. Viz -> Filterable card grid. Interaction -> Filter by level/topic. Justification -> Allows easy access and comparison of practical tasks.
        - Resource Library (HTML/CSS/JS): Report Info -> Courses, papers, communities. Goal -> Organize. Viz -> Tabbed lists. Interaction -> Click to expand paper summaries. Justification -> Consolidates all learning materials into an easily searchable directory.
        - Tools List (HTML/CSS): Report Info -> All mentioned tools/frameworks. Goal -> Inform. Viz -> Categorized list with icons. Interaction -> Static. Justification -> Provides a quick reference for the tech stack to be mastered.
        - CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
