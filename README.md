## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No additional software installation required

### Installation
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `Project_Tracker.html` in your web browser
3. Start exploring your AI learning journey!

### Optional: Enable AI Features
To use the AI-powered project generator and paper explanations:
1. Get a Google AI Studio API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Add your API key to the `API_KEY` variable in the JavaScript code (line ~310)
3. The AI features will automatically become available

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Visual Design
- **Calm Harmony Palette**: Slate/Zinc with Sky accent colors
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects, smooth transitions, and visual feedback

### User Experience

- **Component-based Structure**: Reduces cognitive load and improves usability
- **Mobile-responsive**: Works seamlessly across all device sizes

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure and accessibility
- **CSS3**: Styling with Tailwind CSS framework
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Interactive functionality and data management
- **Chart.js**: Dynamic skill visualization

### External APIs
- **Google Gemini API**: AI-powered project generation and explanations
- **CDN Resources**: Tailwind CSS and Chart.js from CDN

### Data Management
- **Client-side Storage**: All roadmap data embedded in JavaScript
- **Local State Management**: Progress tracking via DOM manipulation

## 📁 Project Structure

```
Project_Tracker.html          # Main application file
README.md                     # This documentation file
```

The application is self-contained in a single HTML file for simplicity and portability.
